Programming Assignment 2-4
The records of a database table Product have been stored in text format using delimiters “:” and “,” in the following way: Different rows are separated by “:” and, within a particular record, different column entries are separated by “,”. In each record, the first column is always productId.
Write a program (called Prog4) that will read such a text file and extract all the product id’s that occur in the file. Your program should then output these values to the console in the following form: (this is a typical example)
134A
213A
911C
012E
662Z
Since we have not yet discussed how to read a file in Java, a text file is provided for you in this assignment in the form of a separate Java class, called Data. The records have been stored as a long String in Data, named records. To access this String within your own program, you can use this line of code:
myString = Data.records;

This project includes:
App class -> main
Data class -> contain the data
Prog4 class -> methods to convet the string to array, take the id from each product, and apply this methods to any String of any size.
Test -> include Junit test, this project was developed using TDD methodology.

For more information look the comments into the code.
